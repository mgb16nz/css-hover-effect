# css-hover-effect

A collection of CSS Hover Effects that I will gradually add more into this project as I pick them up whenever I use them.

This CSS collection of Hover Effects which I will slowly over time keep adding more samples of. I wish to share with others that are looking for new CSS hover effects ideas without the use of using JavaScript or jQuery etc.
